# Little Paint
It's a simple graphical editor (analogue to Paint in WinXP) that is implemented with Qt. 

Its features are:
* Drawing graphic primitives (rectangle/square, triangle, ellipse/circle, line, curve)
* The choice of color, type and thickness of lines; color and fill type.
* Palette (the choice of the set or select the color from a full palette of colors).
* Support graphic formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP).
* Install/uninstall the program using the [installation file *.msi] (https://yadi.sk/d/przDzmptsF2WU)
